### An Online Web-Streaming Service for Bitcoin-Exchanges

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin from private investors, major financial institutions and governments. Investors require a mechanism to convert between fiat currency and cryptocurrency (and between cryptocurrencies) so several public exchanges (e.g. GDAX) have been created to enable cross-currency trading. Like any exchange, cryptocurrency exchanges have attracted day traders employing a variety of computational finance techniques. 

In this project, students will retrieve, store, and visualize data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. Students will also employ data modelling techniques to find suitable data-structures to represent order books of exchanges, will store them in a relational database, and visualize them via a web-interface using java-script. 

Required: python, some web-server technologies (preferable the ones based on python) Helpful: git, familiarity with bitcoin, familiarity with stock/currency exchanges. Student cohort: This project is suitable for MIT/MITM students.
